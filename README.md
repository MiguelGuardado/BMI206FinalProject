# BMI206FinalProject
This is used to store code/data used for my final project for my Biostatistics class at University of California San Francisco.

The overall goal of the project was to replicate of the results of a recently published paper, with focus on the statistical analysis preformed. There were two mains parts of this project, with the first being a group focused project to replicate a figure from a paper. The second part of the project was individual based, with us trying to further the analysis and intrepretation set out by the paper by testing the sentitivity of the results found. This repository will inclde code used for my group project as well as my individual. My code should be taken as it but am happy for anybody to use this code for further analysis + intrepretation.

The Paper I used for my final project was: Kim, EY., Ashlock, D. & Yoon, S. Identification of critical connectors in the directed reaction-centric graphs of microbial metabolic networks. BMC Bioinformatics 20, 328 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2897-z

Data used from this paper is open acsess and should be obtained from there
